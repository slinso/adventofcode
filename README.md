# Advent of Code in Go

Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly series of programming questions based on the [Advent Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar). For each day leading up to christmas, there is one question released, and from the second it is released, there is a timer running and a leaderboard showing who solved it first.
